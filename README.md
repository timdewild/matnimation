# Installation
`matnimation` is not a official python package that can be installed locally. Instead, you have two options to use `matnimation` yourself. The first, and simplest way, is to clone its Github repository inside your project folder. Suppose your project folder is called `my_animation_project`, open your terminal and change directory to that folder. Then use:
```python
git clone git@github.com:timdewild/matnimation.git
``` 
for cloning using SSH or 
```python
git clone https://github.com/timdewild/matnimation.git
```
for https.
